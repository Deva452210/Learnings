Jenkins is an open-source automation server used to automate the building, testing, and deployment of software. 
It supports continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) by enabling developers to automatically build and test code changes, 
making it easier to integrate changes into a project and deliver software more rapidly and reliably.

In Jenkins, the master and slave (now commonly referred to as controller and agent) architecture allows for distributed builds. 
The master (controller) manages tasks such as scheduling jobs, monitoring agents, and reporting results. 
Slaves (agents) are machines configured to execute build jobs dispatched by the master, enabling parallel and platform-specific builds across multiple environments.
