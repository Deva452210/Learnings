Graph in DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting them. Graphs are divided into two main types:
 1. Directed Graph (edges have direction)
 2. Undirected Graph (edges have no direction)

A graph is a data structure made up of nodes (vertices) and connections between them (edges).

Directed Graph (Digraph)
Edges have a direction: Each edge goes from one node to another specific node.
Analogy: Like a one-way street.
Example: If there’s an edge from A to B, you can go from A to B, but not necessarily from B to A.

Undirected Graph
Edges have no direction: Each edge simply connects two nodes, and you can travel both ways.
Analogy: Like a two-way street.
Example: If there’s an edge between A and B, you can go from A to B and from B to A.

Visual Example
Directed:
A → B

Undirected:
A — B

Use Cases
Directed: Web links, Twitter followers, task dependencies.
Undirected: Facebook friends, road maps (if roads are two-way).
